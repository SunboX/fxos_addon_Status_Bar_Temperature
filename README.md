# Status Bar Temperature add-on for Firefox OS

This addon shows the current local temperature in your status bar. The temperature will update if you walk some steps.

Current temperatur is provided by Yahoo's weather forecasting API. This add-on will anonymously send your current location to yahoo. You can define the interval for querying the current temperature on the add-on detail page in the settings.
The temperature format can be set to Celsius (denoted °C) or Fahrenheit (denoted °F).
